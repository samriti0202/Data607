#Problem Statement
* For this assignment, you should take information from a relational database and migrate it to a NoSQL database of your own choosing. 
* For the NoSQL database, you may use MongoDB (which we introduced in week 7), Neo4j, or another NoSQL database of your choosing.
* You should also briefly describe the advantages and disadvantages of storing the data in a relational database vs. your NoSQL database.

#####For this assignment we used data from Assignment2 - In the  week 2 assignemnt data for user reviews for movies ws collected and differnt tables were created to store the user information, survey and movies information.

####Below is  single Cypher query statement composed of multiple CREATE clauses.This query created Nodes with label Movies and its relationship with Reviewer. The following commands were ran in Neo4j browser.

###Describe the advantages and disadvantages of storing the data in a relational database vs. NoSQL database.

<table>
<tr>
<th> </th>
<th> Relational DB</th>
<th> Graph DB</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> Pros</td>
<td align="top" >Expressive query language & secondary Indexes: Users should be able to access and manipulate their data in sophisticated ways to support both operational and analytical applications. Indexes play a critical role in providing efficient access to data, supported natively by the database rather than maintained in application code.

Strong consistency: It is much more complex to build applications around an eventually consistent model, imposing significant work on the developer, even for the most sophisticated engineering teams.

Enterprise Management and Integrations: Organizations need a database that can be secured, monitored, automated, and integrated with their existing technology infrastructure, processes, and staff, including operations teams, DBAs, and data analysts.

</td>
<td align="top">

Flexible data model:Whether document,graph, key-value, or wide-column, all offer a flexible data model making it easy to store and combine data of any structure and allow dynamic modification of the schema without downtime or performance impace.

Scalability and performance:This allows the database to scale out on commodity hardware deployed on-premises or in the cloud, enabling almost unlimited growth with higher throughput and lower latency than relational databases.

Always-on global deployments:They are designed to run across many nodes, including replication to automatically synchronize data across servers, racks, and data centers.
</td>

<tr>
<td> Cons</td>
<td align="top"> Performance problems associated with re-assembling simple data structures into their more complicated real-world representations.

Lack of support for complex base types, e.g., drawings.

SQL is limited when accessing complex data.

Knowledge of the database structure is required to create ad hoc queries.

Locking mechanisms defined by RDBMSs do not allow design transactions to be supported, e.g., the "check in" and "check out" type of feature that would allow an engineer to modify a drawing over the course of several working days.
</td>
<td align="top"> It is a growing technology that will be mature in a few years, so, you have to bet for one and pray for it becoming successful.

Most of them do not have a declarative language, and those that have it lack the capability to optimise queries in a proper way.

You have to use an API.

Many lack native implementations for different platforms, except for Sparksee high-performance graph database, which has native implementations for Linux, Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android and BB10.
